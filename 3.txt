Void Troopers : Sci-fi Tapper – Apps on Google Play4.5PERFECT. I can't say enough. I really love everything about it. I don't mind the ads at all cuz you can choose to watch them or not, when you want to. They aren't automatic. Gameplay is super simple & very relaxing. Easy to understand & learn very quickly. The graphics are adorable, music is peaceful. The value of what you get for watching ads, spending coins, or spending gems is just right, easy to earn, lots of little features that make it great. Customer service is very quick/excellent!Appxplore (iCandy)2,809The Zurlocs are ravaging your galaxy! It’s time to defend your home from alien invaders in this space adventure clicker game.
